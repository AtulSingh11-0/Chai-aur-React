/**
 * This index file exports all the components from the components directory.
 * It allows for easier imports in other parts of the application.
 * For example, instead of importing InputBox from its specific file, you can import it from this index file.
 * This helps in keeping the import statements cleaner and more organized.
 *
 * It is advised to use this file only when there are multiple components to export or when the project structure is more complex.
 * If there is only one component, it is better to import it directly from its file to avoid unnecessary indirection.
